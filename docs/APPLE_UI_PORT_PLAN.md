# Apple Music UI port — working plan

Status as of the end of the 2026-10-18/19 session. Nothing below is started.

## Where things stand

`main` is **v2.1.17 exactly**, plus one thing: Convx's Liquid Glass engine,
ported as source. Tagged and released as **v2.2.0-convx**.

Everything from the earlier v2.2.0–v2.2.6 line was reverted. That line was a
hand-rolled Apple Music shell (1,298 lines) that wrapped the existing screens
instead of porting Convx, and shipped twice with dead controls. It is preserved
on the `archive/am-shell-2.2.x` branch and should not be revived.

Reported on-device: the Convx engine looks better and runs smoother than what it
replaced. `GlassPool.kt` is why — it pools backdrop layers instead of
re-capturing per surface, and it was one of twelve files that were missing
before the port.

**There is no Apple Music shell yet.** The app is the v2.1.17 UI with Convx
glass underneath. That is the whole gap.

## Reference material

- Apple screenshots: `/mnt/gdrive/apple-music-ui/` (official marketing images;
  `manifest.tsv` maps each file to its source URL)
  - `apple-music/iphone/apple-music-iphone-01.png` — Home and the tab bar
  - `apple-music/iphone/apple-music-iphone-03.png` — Now Playing
- Convx source: `/home/ubuntu/convx-repo` (GPL-3.0)

## The target

Now Playing, per `apple-music-iphone-03.png`, top to bottom:

1. Grabber pill
2. Small artwork + title/artist, with star and `•••` circular buttons right
3. Full-bleed blurred artwork behind everything
4. Large left-aligned lyrics — current line solid, neighbours faded
5. Translate pill floating right
6. Progress bar: elapsed left, `Sing` centred, remaining right
7. Rewind / Pause / Forward
8. Volume slider with speaker icons
9. Bottom row: lyrics · AirPlay · queue

Home, per `apple-music-iphone-01.png`: large title, avatar top-right, section
headers with a `>` chevron when tappable, tall hero cards, square album rows.

Tab bar: capsule with Home / New / Radio / Library, and **Search as a separate
circular button outside the capsule**. Selected tab is red icon *and* red label.

## Open decision — icon set

Convx ships lookalike drawables and the user has rejected them as not exact.
Apple's own set is **SF Symbols** (`play.fill`, `pause.fill`, `backward.fill`,
`forward.fill`, `star.fill`, `ellipsis`, `speaker.wave.1-3.fill`,
`quote.bubble`, `list.bullet`, `airplayaudio`, `dot.radiowaves.left.and.right`).
Coverage is complete — there is no gap.

**Blocker:** SF Symbols' licence permits use in applications built for Apple
platforms, not redistribution inside an Android APK. The user is aware and is
deciding. Do not assume it is approved; confirm before shipping it.

This is why step 1 puts every icon behind one indirection — it makes the choice
a one-file swap instead of a rewrite.

## Steps

### 1. `PlayerIcons` indirection
One object mapping each Now Playing control to a drawable. ~15 call sites
across `PlayerControls.kt`, `NowPlayingScreen.kt`, `LandscapePlayer.kt`,
`AudioOutputSheet.kt`, `ArtworkMeshBackdrop.kt`. Safe set to start.

### 2. Apple icon swap
Swap the transport, volume, queue, lyrics, star and ellipsis set through
`PlayerIcons`. No layout changes.

### 3. Artwork zoom
`ArtworkMeshBackdrop.kt` is the **blurred background layer — leave it alone.**
The visible artwork is a separate element sized in `NowPlayingScreen.kt`.
Scale it to Apple's crop: scaled past the frame so it crops and bleeds behind
the header and controls, rather than fitting inside. A transform multiplier
plus overflow. Low risk, no re-rendering changes.

### 4. Held-menu Liquid Glass + morph
`app/.../components/HeldContextMenu.kt` (344 lines) — currently paints a flat
`plate` colour with `RoundedCornerShape(20.dp)` / `16.dp`. No glass.

- Swap `plate` for the ported `Modifier.liquidGlass(...)`.
- Morph the container out of the recorded press origin.

**Menu contents, options and callbacks stay exactly as they are.** Only the
surface changes.

The origin is already recorded: `sharedUi/.../components/LongPressOrigin.kt`
has `HoldCapture` (position + `recordedAt`) behind `longPressMenuClickable`,
already wired into Home, Common and shelf items. The morph needs no new
capture machinery — the existing `cardShape` 20dp → `menuShape` 16dp pair is
what animates.

Route this through the same pooled backdrop path as the rest of the glass. A
menu drawing its own backdrop would undo the smoothness the pool provides.

### 5. Tests
Every control gets an interaction test. `ProfileGestureTest` shows the pattern:
the decision that can be pulled out of Compose is extracted and tested as plain
logic so it runs on any host.

### 6. Build
`:app:compileDevDebugKotlin` → unit tests → `verify_ui_parity.py --strict` →
CI `Flow Debug APK` (the four-ABI minified build) → attach APKs to the release.

Attach APKs and publish the release in the same session as the build. Two
earlier releases shipped with nothing attached, or as a draft nobody could see.

## Known environment constraints

- **Native builds cannot run on this host.** The NDK's x86_64 clang segfaults
  under qemu on this aarch64 machine. Reproduces on an unmodified tree. The
  APK build is CI's job — `Flow Debug APK` is the workflow that produces the
  release assets.
- **Robolectric cannot run on this host either.** It loads Conscrypt's native
  library by JNI and Conscrypt publishes no linux-aarch64 build. Those tests are
  excluded on aarch64 via `build.gradle.kts` and run for real on CI's x86_64.
- The `Android Release APK` (signed prod) workflow fails on the repo's
  keystore — `Tag number over 30 is not supported`. Pre-existing; also fails on
  v2.2.4. Blocks every signed prod build until fixed separately.
- 16 unit tests fail on a clean tree: `GeniusTest` and `LocaleStringsTest`. This
  is the baseline, not a regression.

## Rules for this work

- A screen is not done until it compiles **and** has an interaction test that
  taps its controls.
- Never report something as working on the strength of "it compiled". That is
  how a dead account button, a dead account menu and an entire invisible glass
  engine were each reported as shipped.
- Convx-derived code is GPL-3.0 and BitChord is GPL-3.0. `NOTICE` records the
  vendoring; keep it accurate as more is ported.

## Untracked leftovers

24 Convx drawables and 3 PNGs were copied into `res/` and are wired to nothing.
They are placeholders for step 2. Delete them if the icon set changes.

## Still open, not planned

- Home screen, tab bar, Radio as its own destination, Library, Search
- The press-and-hold menu question is answered above; the other menus were not
  investigated
## Now Playing restyle — exact measurements (authoritative, from the owner)

Units: W = screen width; 1% W = 10.8px on the owner's 1080px-wide screen. All Y
from the top of the screen. Positions are %-of-WIDTH, never %-of-height.

1) ALBUM ART (banner): scale ×1.234 uniform, transform-origin 50% 0 (top
   centre), then translateY +1.6% W (~17px). On a wrapper so it multiplies with
   the existing sleeve animation, not replaces it. Full-width art becomes
   123.4% W, ~11.7% W cropped each side. Bottom fade/mask scales with the art.
2) TITLE ROW: title/artist font ×0.86. Title top Y = 122.7% W (1325px). Artist
   line bottom Y = 132.2% W (1428px). Star/ellipsis diameter 8.0% W (86px,
   ×0.84), gap between them 4.0% W, vertical centre Y = 127.5% W (1377px),
   ellipsis right edge at 92% W. Left margin 8.4% W.
3) PROGRESS: centre Y = 142.5% W (1539px, current). Thickness 1.7% W (18px,
   from 20). Spans 8%–92% W. Time labels centre Y = 148.0% W (1595px, +9px).
4) CONTROLS (row centre Y = 167.0% W, unchanged): pause 7.4% W × 9.9% W
   (80×107px; bars 3.0% W, gap 1.4% W; ×0.60 of current), centred at 50% W.
   Rewind/forward 9.8% W × 5.6% W each (105×60px, ×0.95), centres 23.4% W
   (253px) and 76.5% W (826px) — each moves inward ~33px.
5) VOLUME: row centre Y = 189.5% W (2047px, +25px). Bar thickness 1.6% W
   (17px). Track 14.5%–83.3% W. Speakers at 8.9% W and 91% W.
6) BOTTOM ROW: centre Y = 200.5% W (2161px, +7px). Icon size unchanged
   (~5.4% W). Lyrics centre X = 21.5% W (232px), queue centre X = 78.2% W
   (845px), centre icon at 50% — outer icons move inward ~63px.

DO NOT MODIFY: status bar, grabber, "Playing from…", Opus/Automix lines,
lyric-preview row, device label. Info lines overlay the art's lower fade
(z above art). Title moving down leaves only ~13px to the lyric-preview row —
reduce its spacing or hide if cramped. VERIFY at 1080px wide, every Y ±3px.

## Playback bug report — one user, SM-S928B, Android 16, build 2.2.2

Symptom: selecting a song does not auto-play (no buffering shown either); track
switches land paused and must be resumed manually. Log preserved by the owner,
key line: `id=TFTnJzWRTJ8`, `substitution=true request=Lossless`.

### What the log proves

1. **Track start took ~23 SECONDS, all of it in the resolver, none of it
   "buffering".** `TIMING track selected` 22:21:45.9 → `first audio` at
   22:22:08.8 (22936ms). The cost is two 8s `PlayerRequestTimeoutException`s
   on the same VISIONOS client (45.9→53.8, →62.0), then "no playable clients",
   then a THIRD attempt on the same client succeeding at 20.4s elapsed. The
   resolver retried the same client into the same timeout twice before the
   failover that worked.
2. **"Doesn't show buffering" is explained: nothing is buffering.** The 20s is
   resolve time, before any media item reaches the player — the player has no
   buffering state to report, so the UI correctly shows nothing. The UI needs
   a resolving state, or the resolve needs to stop taking 20s. Both, ideally.
3. **Queue warm-up was cancelled**: `queue warm-up skipped TFTnJzWRTJ8:
   StandaloneCoroutine was cancelled` — so the prefetch of this track never
   ran, guaranteeing a cold resolve.
4. **The track-switch path looks different from the first-selection path.** At
   22:36:20 (the "switch song" case): `audio switch applying 'Naal Nachna
   (From "Dhurandhar")' (P4UnrmPFPA4)` — the LOSSLESS SUBSTITUTION flow, active
   because request=Lossless — then decoder init and AudioTrack within 122ms,
   **but no `TIMING first audio` line ever follows**, plus two tidal searches
   cancelled mid-flight. Prepared but never started = lands paused = the
   "must resume" symptom. Prime suspect: the audio-switch/substitution path
   does not carry playWhenReady.
5. Tidal addon degraded (`1 of 8 instances live`) — irrelevant to the main bug;
   it only slows the lossless chase.

### Fixes to investigate (next session, in order of expected payoff)

1. The audio-switch/substitution path carrying `playWhenReady` into the
   prepared source — the 22:36 event is the smoking gun.
2. Resolver failover: stop retrying the same VISIONOS client into the same 8s
   timeout twice; fail over to the next client on first timeout.
3. A resolving state in the Now Playing UI for the pre-player gap.
4. Why queue warm-up is being cancelled on selection.
