<h1><a id="extra-features"></a>Extra features (on top of everything BitChord does)</h1>

Everything upstream BitChord ships — search, playback, downloads, lyrics, Discord presence, scrobbling — plus:

#### Flow
- **Deezer-style endless personal mix** — unlocks at 16 favorites, moods, discovery slider, genre tuner, trains on skips and bans.
- **One mix stays, refreshes hourly**, survives restarts, never autoplays until you press play.

#### Classipod
- **Full iPod Classic theme** — click-wheel navigation, Cover Flow, A–Z search, Now Playing modes, per-page wheel slots.

#### Sound
- **Automix V2** — DJ-style transitions with entrance rescoring and vocal gating.
- **Sing (karaoke)** — turn the lead vocal down and sing over the track, mic button in lyrics.
- **Honest lossless numbers** — stats-for-nerds and Discord show the PCM decode rate (1411/4608), never a bogus container figure.

#### Library & downloads
- **Downloads play at your settings quality when online**, file stays the offline path with failure fallback.
- **Instant downloads screen** — snapshot first paint, memoized reopen, batched verification, single-song cache updates.
- **Save cover art** from any song menu.

<h1><a id="lossless-addons"></a>Lossless addons</h1>

Extra sources under Sources, each with health checks and honest failure states:

- **BitChord NEXT** — genuine Hi-Fi FLAC via community instances with automatic failover and daily list refresh.
- **BitChord Hi-Res** — direct measured FLAC files, no converter, no account, no waiting.
- **BitChord Lossless** — catalogue search plus queued FLAC conversions up to 24/192. One in-app-browser unlock mints a resuming session; the row tells you when it needs renewing or the converter is down.
- Stream refusals report themselves on the Sources rows instead of failing silently.

> **Why no provider names?** The backends behind these addons are volunteers' servers and free tiers. Naming them draws traffic, and traffic gets things rate-limited or shut down — so the app shows only its own addon names. Nothing is hidden from you technically: every endpoint, ritual and fallback lives in the source, in plain sight, for anyone who knows where to look.

<h1><a id="download"></a>Download</h1>

Grab the latest signed APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/OreoMuncher45/BitChord/releases) page — `arm64-v8a` fits almost all modern phones (`armeabi-v7a`, `x86_64` and `universal` are there too). Sideloading requires enabling "Install unknown apps" for whichever app you download it with. Updates install over the old build; your library, downloads and settings carry over.

BitChord Next is free and open source, and it's staying that way. No telemetry, no accounts, no ads, no "Pro" tier, and no plan to add one.

The upstream author takes tips on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/kushagrasinghx) — without his BitChord, none of this exists.

Anything is appreciated, nothing is expected. A star, a bug report, or a pull request is just as welcome.
