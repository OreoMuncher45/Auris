/**
 * The signed-in library: the saved collections, as shelves of cards.
 *
 * Deliberately only the collections. This page used to end with two runs of
 * track rows — "Liked Music" and "Songs" — which are two overlapping answers
 * to the same question and read as one list that couldn't make up its mind: a
 * track that stopped being liked didn't leave the page, it moved down it, into
 * a section most people had taken for more of the same. Liked Music is a
 * playlist, and it is reached the way every other playlist here is, by opening
 * its card.
 *
 * The liked list is still fetched — it is what the rest of the app reads a
 * track's rating off (see MainViewModel's `likeStatuses`); it just isn't a
 * second place to browse it.
